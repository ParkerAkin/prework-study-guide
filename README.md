# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to make a webpage where i could store all my notes for the bootcamp in one place. I also wanted to be able to easily find and share my notes that are on this webpage. Having a webpage for my notes solves the problem of lost notes. I learned that coding seems very difficult, but is much more intuitive then I had thought.

## Usage

The main use for the study guide website is to compile my information about coding in order to use it at a later date for studying. The DevTools console can be used to see the JavaScript running. It will help with visualizing how the code works and will choose a topic to start studying.
